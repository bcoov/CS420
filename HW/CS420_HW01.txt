To be submitted in class.

1) What is the purpose of system calls?

    Interface to the OS's operations/services. Typically called via an API instead
    of directly calling the system call.

2) Describe three general methods for passing parameters to the operating system.

    - Registers
    - Stored in memory block/table and accessed via passing the address location
    - Placed onto stack to be popped off by the OS

3) What are the two models of interprocess communication?
   What are the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches?

   - Message passing
    - (Pro) Messages cause work to remain separated to avoid modification of
      other worker's data
    - (Con) All arguments must be copied into the new message
   - Shared memory
    - (Pro) Allows processes to run concurrently
    - (Pro) Once initiated, processes are treated like typical memory accesses
    - (Con) Must be properly synchronized since all processes access the same
      data simultaneously

4) What are some of the advantages of the microkernel approach to system design?
   What are some of the disadvantages of using the microkernel approach?

   - Advantages
    - Easier to extend and port to new architectures
    - Less code running in kernel mode and more secure
   - Disadvantages
    - Performance overhead
